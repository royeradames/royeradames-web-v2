# Accessibility Improvements

This document tracks accessibility enhancements made to the royeradames-web-v2 project to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines and improve user experience for assistive technologies.

## Contact List Accessibility

**File:** `src/app/pages/main/components/hero/contact/contact.html`

**Issue:** The contact information list lacked semantic context for screen reader users. Without proper labeling, screen readers would announce it as just "list" without indicating its purpose.

**Solution:** Added `aria-label="Contact information"` to the `<ul>` element.

```html
<ul class="contact__list" aria-label="Contact information"></ul>
```

**Benefits:**

- Screen readers now announce "Contact information list" providing clear context
- Maintains clean visual design without requiring additional heading elements
- Follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines for providing accessible names to UI components
- Improves navigation experience for users with assistive technologies

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**

- **Visible heading:** Would provide semantic structure but impacts visual design
- **`aria-labelledby`:** Requires an existing heading element to reference
- **`role="list"`:** Only necessary if CSS removes default list semantics

**Date Implemented:** December 2024

## Future Accessibility Considerations

- [ ] Review all lists throughout the application for proper labeling
- [ ] Audit form elements for proper labels and error handling
- [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation flow
- [ ] Validate heading hierarchy structure
